# DeepWay.v2
Autonomous navigation for blind people
# Steps
1. Collecting Training data.
2. Labelling training data.

# Things to acheieve:
1. Collecting data
2. training a simple classifier
3. generating data for segmentation of roads and people
4. training UNET
5. running everything on nano
6. Generating lines(making your own lanes
7. pushing the person the leftmost lane
8. AAgar admi agle lane me aata hai to lane change
9. Navigation using GPS module
